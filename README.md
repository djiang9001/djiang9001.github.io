# Personal Website

This is my personal website, created using React-Static, deployed on GitHub Pages.

See it [here](https://djiang9001.github.io).

### Development

If you have Docker, simply `make dev` to start up a container. Once in the container, you can use the other `make` targets.
For example, `make start` starts a development server at `localhost:3000`. See the `Makefile` for more info.
